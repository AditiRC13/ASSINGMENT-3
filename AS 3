Question1
When to use a for loop-
*In a computer programming language ,for loop is used to have a precise and concise loop structure .
*It is an entry control system ,with the help of a for loop repeated exicution of a statement is done .
*They are used to reduce the size of the code 
*For loop is used to check the given specific condition ,and the program is run until the desired condition is met.
*With the use of for loop, the following actions can be performed at ones -Initialization,Evaluation ,Incrimentation.
 
 input_list =[10,20,3,40,50]
 print("input_list elements")
 for elements in input_list :
    print(element)
    
 When to use while loop-
 *It is also used for repeated exicution of statement 
 *In this loop number of iterrations can be infinite unless the given statement is reached or satisfied.
 
i=1
while i<10
  print(i)
  i=i+10
  
Question 2
i=1
sum=0
wile(i<=10):
   sum =sum+1
   i=i+1
   
Question 3
unit_consumed=int(input("enter unit of electricity consumed"):
if unit consumed <=100:
     a = unit_consumed*4.5
elif unit_consumed <=200:
     a = 100*4.5 + (unit_consumed -100)*6
elif unit_consumed <=300:
     a = 100*4.5 + 100*6 +(unit_consumed -200)*10
else :
     a = 100*4.5 +100*6 + 100*10 + (unit_consumed -300)*20
     print("your electricity bill is ","rs",a)
     
question 4
l2=[]
i=1
while i in range(1,101)
     if 1/4 ==0 0r i/5==0:
       l2.append(i**3)
       i=i+1
       print(l2)
       
       
question 5
def vowel_count(str=" I want to become a data scientist")
      count=0
      vowel = set("aeiouAEIOU")
      for alphs in vowel :
          count =count+1
     print (count)
